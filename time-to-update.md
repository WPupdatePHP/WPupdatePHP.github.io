You probably ended up here, after seeing a message in your WordPress administration panel, that you are running an outdated version of PHP. Sorry about that, we didn't really want to disturb you with such a rude message, but unfortunately it's true.

If you saw this message, it means you are running an outdated version of PHP. You don't have to worry, even if you don't know how to update PHP or don't know what PHP is, in most cases it's really easy to update. Most hosting companies already offer more recent versions of PHP.

## How to update your PHP version
The easiest way to find out how you can update your PHP version, is by [contacting your host](/contact-host). In most cases it is really easy to update and your host can do this in minutes.

In some cases, your hosting company might refuse to update your PHP version for whatever reason. This is a really bad practice, but it happens. If you want to migrate your website to a new hosting company, there are plenty options available.

On the [phpversions.info website](http://phpversions.info/) you can find an overview of hosting companies and their available PHP versions. Most hosts offer more recent versions of PHP already.
