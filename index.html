    <h2>What is PHP?</h2>
    <p>PHP is a scripting language that powers many websites. As any piece of software, PHP is available in different versions. Some versions are no longer supported. Unfortunately, some hosting companies run really old and potentially insecure PHP versions.</p>
    <p>WordPress has PHP 5.2.4 as the <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/">minimum required version</a>. This is a version that is unsupported since early 2011. The PHP 5.3.* versions are unsupported since August 2014 as well. This means that these versions didn't get any updates since then and leaves them as potentially insecure.</p>
