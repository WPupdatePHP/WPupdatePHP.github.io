  <h1>WPupdatePHP: Time to update your PHP version</h1>
  <p>You probably ended up here, after seeing a message in your WordPress administration panel, that you are running an outdated version of PHP. Sorry about that, we didn't really want to disturb you with such a rude message, but unfortunately it's true.</p>
  <p>If you saw this message, it means you are running an outdated version of PHP. You don't have to worry, even if you don't know how to update PHP or don't know what PHP is, in most cases it's really easy to update. Most hosting companies already offer more recent versions of PHP.</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <h2>What is PHP?</h2>
    <p>PHP is a scripting language that powers many websites. As any piece of software, PHP is available in different versions. Some versions are no longer supported. Unfortunately, some hosting companies run really old and potentially insecure PHP versions.</p>
    <p>WordPress has PHP 5.2.4 as the <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/">minimum required version</a>. This is a version that is unsupported since early 2011. The PHP 5.3.* versions are unsupported since August 2014 as well. This means that these versions didn't get any updates since then and leaves them as potentially insecure.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Why we do this</h2>
  <p>The developers of the affiliated plugins no longer want to support these old versions of PHP.</p>
  <p>PHP.net lists <a href="http://php.net/eol.php">all unsupported versions</a>.</p>

  <h2>How to update your PHP version</h2>
  <p>The easiest way to find out how you can update your PHP version, is by <a href="/contact-host">contacting your host</a>. In most cases it is really easy to update and your host can do this in minutes.</p>
  <p>In some cases, your hosting company might refuse to update your PHP version for whatever reason. This is a really bad practice, but it happens. If you want to migrate your website to a new hosting company, there are plenty options available.</p>
  <p>On the <a href="http://phpversions.info/">phpversions.info</a> website you can find an overview of hosting companies and their available PHP versions. Most hosts offer more recent versions of PHP already.</p>
